- **Rendering**: Translucent blue material (70% opacity)
- **Borders**: Black highlighted lines at 0° and 180°
- **Position**: Centered in viewport, visible from Y-axis (lateral view)

### 2. BOH Lines System ✅ COMPLETED
- **BOH Line 1**: z=0 → z=15 (bottom to center)
- **BOH Line 2**: z=15 → z=30 (center to top)
- **Position**: 90° on cylinder surface (configurable 70°-110°)
- **Rendering**: Red color, 3px width
- **Geometry**: Correct cylindrical coordinate calculations

### 3. BOH Interactive Controls ✅ WORKING
- **UI Panel**: Right sidebar with sliders

- **Components**: Modular, well-organized
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for state management (`useBOHLines`)
- **Configuration**: Centralized in `lib/config.ts`
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive specs and guides
- **Testing**: Unit tests for components

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Issue #1: Mask-Cylinder Alignment Varies with Viewport Size
**Status**: 🔴 ACTIVE - HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem**: 
- Camera feed mask and virtual cylinder don't align consistently
- Alignment works for specific viewport sizes but breaks on resize
- Three.js projection produces invalid coordinates (outside 0-100% range)

**Root Cause**:
- Separate overlay architecture (video + canvas)
- CSS clipPath vs. Three.js coordinate system mismatch
- Container dimensions change unpredictably

**Impact**:
- User experience degraded on different screen sizes
- Manual adjustment needed for each viewport
- Not production-ready

**Recommended Solution**:
- Complete architecture change to unified WebGL rendering
- Use video as texture on 3D plane
- Render everything in single Three.js context
- Estimated implementation: 2-3 hours

**Detailed analysis**: See `docs/ISSUES.md`

## 🎯 What Works Perfectly

1. ✅ **Virtual Cylinder Rendering**
   - Correct dimensions and proportions
   - Beautiful translucent material
   - Proper Z-axis alignment
   - Visible from lateral view (Y-axis camera)

2. ✅ **BOH Lines Rendering**
   - Two distinct lines (bottom-center, center-top)
   - Positioned at 90° initially
   - Red color clearly visible
   - Correct cylindrical surface positioning

3. ✅ **Interactive Controls**
   - Sliders work smoothly
   - Range constraint (70°-110°) enforced
   - Real-time visual updates
   - Reset functionality
   - No performance issues

4. ✅ **Animation System**
   - Continuous rendering loop
   - Scene persistence (no recreation)
   - Efficient geometry updates only
   - 30+ FPS maintained

## 🔧 What Needs Work

1. ⚠️ **Mask-Cylinder Alignment** (High Priority)
   - Current: Works for some viewport sizes
   - Needed: Works for ALL viewport sizes
   - Solution: WebGL unified rendering

2. ⏳ **Touch/Drag Interaction** (Not Started)
   - Current: Only slider controls
   - Planned: Direct touch/drag on BOH lines
   - Estimated: 1-2 hours

3. ⏳ **Point Trio Selection** (Not Started)
   - Next major feature after alignment fix
   - Estimated: 3-4 hours

---

## 📋 Recommendations for Next Session

### Priority 1: Fix Alignment Issue (2-3 hours)
Implement unified WebGL rendering architecture:
1. Create video texture from camera feed
2. Render video on background plane
3. Render cylinder geometry in same 3D space
4. Use stencil buffer or shader for masking
5. Test across multiple viewport sizes

### Priority 2: Add Touch/Drag to BOH Lines (1-2 hours)
Once alignment is fixed:
1. Add pointer event handlers to canvas
2. Implement raycasting to detect BOH line hits
3. Calculate angular displacement from drag
4. Add visual feedback (glow/highlight)

### Priority 3: Begin Point Trio Selection (3-4 hours)
1. Click/touch to select points on cylinder surface
2. Visual markers for selected points
3. Trio grouping logic
4. Plane generation from trios

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **CSS + Three.js Coordinate Systems**: Don't mix well for precise alignment
2. **Projection API Limitations**: `vector.project()` unreliable for this use case
3. **Viewport Variations**: Must design for responsive/variable sizes from start
4. **Architecture Matters**: Separate overlays create synchronization challenges
5. **Testing Approach**: Need to test on multiple viewport sizes early

## 🎓 Technical Insights

### What We Learned About Three.js + React:
1. Refs are essential for persistent scene management
2. Separate useEffects for initialization vs. updates
3. Animation loops must be external to React lifecycle
4. Geometry updates cheaper than scene recreation

### What We Learned About WebGL:
1. Projection matrix calculations complex with perspective cameras
2. NDC (Normalized Device Coordinates) can exceed [-1, 1] range
3. CSS and WebGL don't share coordinate systems naturally
4. Video textures offer better integration than overlays

### Best Practices Established:
1. Always log projection values for debugging
2. Test with multiple viewport sizes early
3. Use refs for Three.js objects, state for React data
4. Document issues immediately with solution approaches
