## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Work on feature...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement your feature"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Integration Process
```bash
# Merge feature to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin develop
```

### 3. Release Process
```bash
# Merge develop to main for release
git checkout main
git merge develop
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin main --tags
```

## Branch Protection Rules (Recommended)

### Main Branch
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to main

### Develop Branch
- Require pull request reviews
- Allow force pushes (for rebasing)
- Require status checks to pass

## Feature Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/phase-description` - New features
- `hotfix/issue-description` - Critical fixes
- `docs/update-description` - Documentation
- `refactor/component-name` - Code improvements

## Merge Strategy

- **Feature â†’ Develop**: Squash and merge
- **Develop â†’ Main**: Merge commit
- **Hotfix â†’ Main**: Direct merge, then back to develop

## Timeline Integration

Each feature branch corresponds to a specific phase in the 20-hour development timeline:

1. **Foundation** (4h) â†’ `feature/foundation-setup` + `feature/ui-framework`
2. **Camera & AR** (9h) â†’ `feature/camera-system` + `feature/ar-visualization` + `feature/virtual-geometry` + `feature/boh-lines`
3. **Measurement Engine** (16h) â†’ `feature/point-management` + `feature/calculation-engine` + `feature/point-trios` + `feature/manual-depth` + `feature/auto-depth-calculation` + `feature/plane-generation` + `feature/ellipse-intersection` + `feature/alpha-beta-angles`
4. **Control Panel** (3h) â†’ `feature/control-panel`
5. **Reporting** (2h) â†’ `feature/measurement-display` + `feature/ac-report`

## Virtual Geometry Specifications

### Core Virtual Cylinder

## Next Steps

1. Start with `feature/foundation-setup`
2. Complete Phase 1 features before moving to Phase 2
3. Use feature branches for parallel development when possible
4. Regular integration through `develop` branch
5. Release to `main` when MVP is complete
