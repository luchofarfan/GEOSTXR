[33m4a4529a[m fix: Prevent infinite re-render loop in edge alignment (error 310)
[33m6a2a713[m feat: Add video zoom controls - zoom feed while keeping virtual cylinder size fixed
[33m765ea29[m feat: Auto-capture photo when cylinder edges align perfectly for 2 seconds
[33md89b8df[m fix: Flip video horizontally to correct mirror effect
[33m19e92ce[m feat: Show full camera feed in live view, apply cylindrical mask only on captured photo
[33m81ca2ad[m fix: Re-enable edge detection with lines limited to cylinder visible area (middle 80% of screen)
[33me21ece7[m fix: Disable edge alignment overlay - lines were appearing outside cylinder mask
[33mebfd187[m fix: Swap BOH Z positions - BOH1 (red) now z=15-30 upper, BOH2 (green) z=0-15 lower
[33m486f50b[m fix: Increase camera distance to 35cm and center at z=15 to reduce perspective distortion and keep BOHs within cylinder bounds

[33m43b788e[m feat: Add visible debug panel for BOH diagnostics on mobile
[33mbbfadda[m debug: Add detailed logging for BOH 3D positions and 2D projections
[33mbf9ee3a[m fix: Correct BOH drag direction and add wider touch areas for mobile interaction
[33ma6b1d67[m fix: Lower camera position to z=10 to show full cylinder from bottom (BOH red visible)
[33m0caebf4[m fix: Increase FOV to 85deg for mobile to ensure full 30cm cylinder and both BOHs visible
[33mfc02d56[m fix: Remove vertical flip and increase FOV to 75deg for full cylinder visibility
[33meee6a0c[m fix: Increase FOV to 65deg for mobile portrait to show full 30cm cylinder
[33m83a21ab[m feat: Add automatic cylinder edge detection and alignment overlay
